## This is a beginner code for a Discord Bot

### Description

To everyone who wants to start where I did, this is my first big python project. The discord bot "Greatest" is used for moderation of discord servers and channels. 

### What it can do:
- "Autorole": Automatically assigns new users roles.
- "Count": Member, User, Bot Count Voice Channels.
- "Door": Welcome Messages
- "MediaOnly": Makes a channel media only, meaning only images, links and videos can be sent.
- "Misc": Miscellaneous commands such as getting a server's member, user and bot count. 
- "Moderation": Basic moderation commands such as locking a channel (no messages can be sent). 
- "Profile": Get profile picture and banners of users. 
- "Quote": Quote a message from a user. 
- "ReactionRole": Assigns a user a role when reacting on a message with a specific emoji. 

If you're interested in seeing the bot operate, check it out on the discord server [HERE](https://discord.com/invite/zSFZayJ3V8)

#### Note: This is my first discord bot and python project, if you see any flaws, feel free to point them out.
